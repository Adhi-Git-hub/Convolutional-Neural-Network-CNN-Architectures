# Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-Architectures
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is a neural network architecture in Deep Learning, used to recognize the pattern from structured arrays. However, over many years, CNN architectures have evolved. Many variants of the fundamental CNN Architecture This been developed, leading to amazing advances in the growing deep-learning field.
